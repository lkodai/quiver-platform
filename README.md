# Quiver Platform

A collection of UI modules as sass objects for rapid prototyping, maintaining styles and code across projects. This is a public rebranding and reorganization of a rad internal tool we felt couldn't be kept from the public any longer.

We are using a hybrid of B.E.M. and SMACSS -- two OOCSS approaches [outlined here](https://medium.com/objects-in-space/f6f404727) to structure our projects, and naming conventions.
