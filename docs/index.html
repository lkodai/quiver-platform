      <p>As a designer....</p>
      <ol class="list--ordered">
        <li>How can I manage my design guidelines across multiple projects? </li>
        <li>How can I work most efficiently with the other designer(s)?</li>
        <li>How can I enable developers to use established interface pieces together without me?</li>
        <li>How can I avoid reinventing the wheel?</li>
        <li>How can I fix a display bug that has been used in multiple places without hating life?</li>
        <li>How can I version my iterative interface work?</li>
        <li>How can I share a code base without bloating out every project with hundreds of unused lines of code?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>All of these issues can be solved (or at least helped) by collaborating on a single code base that gets pulled into each project, like a third-party dependency, and has a way to configure the specifics to avoid too much bloat. We are able to maintain consistency, share solutions to design and technical problems, and repeat ourselves much less.</p>

      <h2>Ok... but what is all this?</h2>

          <h3>It's a Design System,</h3>
          <p>Or a 'Living Style Guide' or whichever popular term you're fond of when discussing a collection of design rules and guidelines to keep your website or application consistent. It holds color and type variables for easy up-keep, and allows for a visible, shareable record of design choices and art direction. The cool thing about this over something like a static PDF that gets passed around the office, is that it continues to evolve and reflect the current state of your projects. The responsive and multi-device support features are just as accessible as the color palette and font choices. It also exists in the same medium as your final product does, so there is no loss in translation from static documents.</p>

          <h3>It's a Prototyping Tool,</h3>
          <p>Because this tool is 'living' or rather, written with actual html and (s)css, it can be used not only for maintaining a production-level product and design documentation, but also for quickly building new products that should have a consistent look and experience to your other projects. It's very similar to connecting legos together to build a new race car. You have all the basic pieces, so you can spend more time on the specific details, and less time reinventing the wheel.</p>

          <h3>It's a Distribution Example</h3>
          <p>Andrew has worked super hard on finding the fastest, easiest, slimest way to share these files across any web project at all. The import ability of scss is a key piece of keeping each installation of Quiver slimmed down, and the overall Quiver project is set up as a bower package that can be included and updated like other popular packages (bourbon, font awesome, etc). We'd be pleased as punch if you poked around what we've done here and decided you wanted to do your own version to fit your own specific set of needs. Most information about the technical interworkings and getting Quiver up and running can be found on the <a href="#">installation page</a>.</p>
