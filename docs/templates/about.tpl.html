      <h1>About Quiver</h1>
        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <section class="project">
          <p>Quiver was born from a simple desire to have a proper style guide at Incomm Digital Solutions, and grew to a very handy multi-purpose tool. After several months of part-time development, the TotallyRad&reg; meter was off the charts, and so we polished her up and decided to share with the public. We use it as a living style guide, a rapid prototyping tool, a simpler-to-maintain production code base, a development sandbox, an accountability check, and a neato side-project to keep ourselves jazzed. You can read in more detail about what is going on here on our [wherever we end up putting the educational copy].<br/>
          <br/>
          We hope you find Quiver as useful as we do, and please share your feedback with us so we can keep the TotallyRad&reg; meter turned up to full-blast.</p>

            <h3>Andrew Colclough: <a href="https://twitter.com/wtc">@wtc</a></h3>
            <p>Andrew is a world-class tie-fighter pilot and a father of two boys, both of which are doomed to be hardcore nerds. He's been punishing himself with CSS and front-end web tech for several years now, after fleeing the game industry. He regularly enjoys ice cold Bud Light Lime-a-Ritas&reg; with his bros and aspires to become Brad Frost.</p>

            <p>Lauren is actually an alien parading around as a Milky Way Galaxy Earth human. She claims to be "from the internet" to help hide the discrepencies of her fa√ßade. She's swam in the murky waters of CSS and dom-manipulation since she was a pup. She attempted to enjoy a Bud Light Lime-a-Rita&reg; with the bros, but the liquid burned through her insides.
