	<h2>It's a Design System...</h2>
	<p>Or a 'Living Style Guide' or whichever popular term you're fond of when discussing a collection of design rules and guidelines to keep your website or application consistent. It holds color and type variables for easy up-keep, and allows for a visible, share-able record of design choices and art direction. The cool thing about this over say, a static PDF that gets passed around the office, is that it continues to evolve and reflect the current state of your projects. The responsive and multi-device support features are just as accessible as the color palette and font choice. It also exists in the same medium as your final product does, so there is no loss in translation from static documents.
